| Brushed | Brushless |  
|----------------- |-------------------| 
|Uses electromagnet system as rotor surrounded by permanent magnets|magnetic rotor surrounded by electro magnet|  
|Inefficient due to the **power losses from imperfect power transfer** through the commutator system|Efficient without power losses|  
|**Shorter lifetime** due to wear of brushes and commutators |Does not suffer from short lifetime because they doesn't have commutation parts |  
|Lowering voltage reduces speed also reduces torque|Torque is highest at slow speeds|
|Too fast to be useful (requires gearing system to reduce speed)|Frequently used directly without gearing|  -->

### Watt (Power)
- Load that can carry

### Voltage
- Does not affect torque
- Without enough voltage, can’t supply current for the entire system
- Force that pushes current
- For a fixed voltage, the speed of motor is inversely affected by the load.

### Current
- Rise high when there is resistance

### Torque
- Maximum torque that the motor can pull before it stops
- use weight of the robot to find the torque (compare torque with motor torque)
- Motor with torque higher than the torque of robot
- Higher torque, lower speed
- Higher torque, higher current
- Higher torque, higher power, but too much power becomes lower


### Gearing
- trades torque for speed


### Collision
- the higher the power of the motor, the higher the load torque
- when your components are rated 12v you can only supply 12v battery to your components if not more than that will fry your circuits because higher voltage would allow more current to flow through than it should be

## Current
LiPo Rechargeable Battery 11.1V 5200mAH
![bat](https://www.cytron.io/image/cache/catalog/products/LIP-11.1-5200/li-po%20battery-800x800.png)

### Voltage/Cell Count
- nominal(default) voltage of 3.7V. 7.4V battery means there are 2 cells in series (Voltage added together). 2S means 2 series

### Capacity
- measure how much power the battery can hold
- milliamp hours (mAh)/ how much drain can be put on the battery to discharge in one hour

### Discharge Rating (‘C’ rating)
- how fast battery can be discharged safely without harming the battery.
- C in C Rating stands for capacity
- 50C = 50 x Capacity(in Amps)
- C rating = 50 x 5 = 250A
- 250A = Maximum sustained load you can safely put on the battery
- Going higher than that will degrade the battery faster than normal

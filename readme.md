# Motor
Brush DC Motors

Brushless DC Motors
- Efficient
￼
Rate - maximum of what the motor capable of
Voltage
- higher maximum speed 
- Does not affect torque
- Without enough voltage, can’t supply current for the entire system
- Force that pushes current
- For a fixed voltage, the speed of motor is inversely affected by the load.
- increase in voltage = increase in speed

Current
- Rise high when there is resistance

Torque
- Maximum torque that the motor can pull  before it stops
- use weight of the robot to find the torque (compare torque with motor torque)
- Motor with torque higher than the torque of robot
- Higher torque, lower speed
- Higher torque, higher current
- Higher torque, higher power, but too much power becomes lower

- Voltage
- Rated speed
- Rated torque
- Rated current
- Rated power

Gearing
- trades torque for speed

Collision
- the higher the power of the motor, the higher the load torque
- when your components are rated 12v you can only supply 12v battery to your components if not more than that will fry your circuits because higher voltage would allow more current to flow through than it should be

# Battery
battery is low the speed of your motor is decrease

Types
- Nickel Cadmium

Voltage/Cell Count
- nominal(default) voltage of 3.7V. 7.4V battery means there are 2 cells in series (Voltage added together). 2S means 2 series

Capacity
- measure how much power the battery can hold
- milliamp hours (mAh)/ how much drain can be put on the battery to discharge in one hour

Discharge Rating (‘C’ rating)
- how fast battery can be discharged safely without harming the battery.
- C in C Rating stands for capacity
- 50C = 50 x Capacity(in Amps)
- C rating = 50 x 5 = 250A
- 250A = Maximum sustained load you can safely put on the battery
- Going higher than that will degrade the battery faster than normal

Continuous Rating - everything above
Burst Rating - works same, but only applicable in 10-second burst not continuously. When accelerating a vehicle but not for steady speed.
